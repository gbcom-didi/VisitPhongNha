- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component library
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom brand colors and responsive design
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **API Design**: RESTful API with JSON responses
- **Authentication**: Replit Auth integration with OpenID Connect
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage

### Database Architecture
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL with Neon serverless connection
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and schema management

## Key Components

- **users**: User profiles (required for Replit Auth)
- **sessions**: Session storage (required for Replit Auth)
- **categories**: Business categories with colors and icons
