# Getting Around

Phong Nha has two distinct zones: the UNESCO‑listed Phong Nha‑Ke Bang National Park (jungles, mountains and rivers) and a “buffer zone” of rice paddies, villages and rivers. A mix of guided tours and self‑guided activities helps visitors explore both areas. The main ways to get around are outlined below:

# Guided tours

Day tours to caves and park highlights – Many exclusive caves can be visited only with licensed tour operators. Day tours often include a BBQ lunch and stops at several sights in the National Park. Ask your accommodation or local operators such as Victory Road Villas or Phong Nha Farmstay to book.

DIY trekking with local guides – The Botanical Garden inside the park has marked jungle trails and a waterfall; guided treks deeper into the jungle are available through tour companies.

# Motorbike tours

Thang’s Phong Nha Riders – Local riders take visitors on the back of a motorbike to explore the countryside, including the park loop and Bong Lai Valley. A day ride typically costs around 400 000 VND per person (prices vary with stops and duration). Riders can be booked through Victory Road Villas, Phong Nha Farmstay or many homestays.

# Cycling

Bong Lai valley rides – Cycling along the river road to Bong Lai passes rice paddies and villages. The route north of the river offers small hamlets, churches and views to Mountain River Café.

Bike rental – Many hotels rent bicycles; guests at Victory Road Villas and Phong Nha Farmstay often get free bike use and can pick up/drop off bicycles between the businesses. Cycling to the Botanical Garden is possible but involves a steep hill.

# Walking

Rice‑paddy and village walks – Self‑guided walks through rice fields between Phong Nha village, the Farmstay and Bong Lai Valley are scenic and easy. Suggested routes include a 4 km loop through the village crops and a 2 km “Village Walk” at the Farmstay.

​ Longer hikes – A popular day hike is from the village to Bong Lai Valley for lunch at the Pub With Cold Beer. Maps are available for download; guests can get advice from Victory Road Villas or Phong Nha Farmstay.

# Private car / minibus

Charter vehicles – Families or groups can hire cars or minibuses (with or without drivers) to reach local attractions. Bookings can be arranged through hotels, Victory Road Villas or Phong Nha Farmstay.

# Practical tips

Ask locally – For up‑to‑date tour schedules, motorbike availability or bicycle hire, ask your accommodation or the staff at Victory Road Villas or Phong Nha Farmstay. Download maps – Maps of walking and cycling routes are available; carrying one helps when exploring Bong Lai Valley or village loops.

Prepare for hills and weather – Some routes involve steep climbs (e.g., cycling to the Botanical Garden). Bring water, sunscreen and rain gear, as the weather can change quickly.
