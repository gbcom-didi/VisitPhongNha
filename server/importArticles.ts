    contentHtml: `<p>Nowadays, weekly tours visit the Son Doong Cave during what are the dryer months of the year, between January and August. There are many versions of the discovery story of Son Doong getting about on the internet. Here is another one…</p>

  <p>The story starts for the telling in 1990. Members of the British Caving Association have been coming to Phong Nha since 1990 to explore the caves and valleys in the area. In 1989, Howard and Deb Limbert sent letters to the governments of Laos, Burma (Myanmar) and Vietnam requesting permission to explore the caves of each country in remote areas. They never heard back from Laos or Myanmar, which was known then as Burma. Vietnam responded and in a nutshell said “come on over and knock yourself out.”</p>

  <p>The cave enthusiasts were referred to a university in Ha Noi where they would be taken care of and pointed in the right direction. The geologists from the university suggested Ha Long, Ninh Binh, Ha Giang and Mai Chau as possible locations to explore caves and these locations were all visited on that initial trip. However, one of the geology lecturers at the university was from Quang Binh Province and he suggested that the group explore there towards the end of their trip. He explained that he’d been told about stories of Phong Nha Cave growing up but he had not not been there.</p>

  <p>The group of cavers rented an old yellow school bus as their method of travel, with the help of the university staff. It took four days in 1990 to drive from Ha Noi to Quang Binh, before the roads we know today were built, the team travelled on the rough Highway 1 with ferries crossing the rivers instead of bridges. In those days, even getting from the coast of Quang Binh to inland Phong Nha was an arduous full day of travelling on small laneways and cattle paths.</p>

  <p>On arrival in Phong Nha, the group of Brits found munitions piles, old weapons and unexploded ordnance of the US Military (UXO’s) piled up in the front yards of the villager’s huts. They were being sold as scrap metal. There was one brick building in the town, which they found to be a makeshift village hall. This was their home for the following 9 days; the cavers are by nature a resilient breed and they thrive on uncomfortable travel adventures.</p>

  <p>Upon settling in, they proceeded to explore what are now known as Phong Nha Cave and Dark Cave (Hang Toi). Three from the team delved over 8km into Phong Nha Cave and to this day nobody has been back in that far. Howard Limbert, who was on the expedition, likes to say: “less people have been to the end of Phong Nha Cave, than people have been to the moon”, although 100,000’s of tourists now visit the first 1km of the cave every year.</p>

  <p>The group that went right through the length of the Dark Cave found some enormous caverns deep in the cave and some that are located and begin in the area of what is now known as the Abandoned Valley. All of these caves and areas are now visited daily by tourists visiting Phong Nha Ke-Bang National Park.</p>

  <p>Around the same time in 1990, as this expedition was taking place in some of the easier to access caves on the edge of the Karst Massif that now makes up the Phong Nha Ke-Bang Unesco World Heritage area, a young 16 year old local boy named Ho Khanh was hunting with family members deep in the more recently labelled “core zone” of the park.</p>

  <p>At that time, it was a good 20km trek through dense jungle in this relatively unexplored region of the planet, over treacherous mountains shielded by sharp weathered limestone.</p>

  <p>Ho Khanh was separated from the rest of the group, and when a thunderstorm passed he found shelter under an overhanging cliff. When the weather cleared, he noticed what seemed to be clouds bellowing out from the side of the mountain, not even 20m away from where he was stationed. On closer inspection, Ho Khanh found a cave entrance that upon entering by 10 meters saw that the floor dramatically fell away in a sheer cliff, into what seemed like the depths of a dark abyss of nothingness below.</p>

  <p>Ho Khanh left the cave and sought out to find the rest of the hunting party and continued with his day-to-day life.</p>

  <p>In 1994, the Vom Cave System was extensively explored and Paradise Cave visited everyday now by tourists is part of said Vom Cave System, with its labyrinth being physically the longest cave in Vietnam. In 2005 the entrance to Paradise Cave was located from the outside by a local man named Phuong. Mr Phuong happens to be Ho Khanh’s brother-in-law.</p>

  <p>The families of exceptional experienced jungle men all live at the western end of Phong Nha Village, where Ho Khanh and many of the other local families now operate really cool little homestay accommodations for the increasing amount of visitors to the area.</p>

  <p>Fast-forward around a decade to 2005 at which time Ho Khanh was introduced to the now locally seasoned Howard and Deb and the other British cavers who had been caving here every other year or so since the first expedition in 1990. Ho Khanh met Howard and Deb’s group in 2003 and told them that he knew of many caves and seen the many cave entrances over decades of growing up and hunting in the local Jungle. He hadn’t explored them, but this didn’t surprise the Limbert’s or their exploring companions as this was a normal situation for the local people.</p>

  <p>They tended to avoid going beyond the entrance to the caves in the region. There were some exceptions, like Hang En Cave which was used by the Ban Doong minority tribe as a thoroughfare and Phong Nha Cave and Hang Rou which were used during the war for storage and the production of rice wine respectively. Prior to around 2005 the local people here didn’t have flashlights so the darkness of the caves were hard to navigate and besides, it was a widespread superstition of the local people that caves harboured spirits.</p>

  <p>Khanh continued to tell the British cavers about the cloudy cave entrance he discovered when he was seeking shelter whilst hunting as a young boy, located just after and above the waterways of Hang En and Hang Curry converge. Khanh, couldn’t remember the exact location but agreed he’d try to find it for a future expedition.</p>

  <p>In 2009 an expedition was officially organised and led by Howard and Deb Limbert, to explore in this area beyond Hang En and over the mountains, past the dolines of Hang Son Doong, finishing to the north on the National Park’s rugged core zone on Highway 20 somewhere between Hang Tam Co, 8 Ladies Cave and the “A Rem” Minority Village near the Laos border.</p>

  <p>The cavers were guided by Khanh to the entrance of what he’d simply described as a cave he’d seen with clouds coming out. A caver named Adam Spillane was the first to enter. Just beyond the entrance it was found that the cavers would have to descend the steep cliff into the darkness. The group upon exploring some of the interior of the cave were completely breath taken by the sheer dimensions of the caverns found as they moved north, farther into the cave.</p>

  <p>The plan to cross the mountains to Highway 20 was abolished and the rest of the time was spent exploring Hang Son Doong.</p>

  <p>In 2010, the Cavers returned with the National Geographic magazine and TV team to further explore and map the cave. It was proven that by volume that Hang Son Doong is the largest Cave discovered in the world, outrunning Deer Cave in Malaysia, which previously held that distinction.</p>

  <p>A recent visitor and travel blogger has written this great blog article about his experience of Phong Nha and Vietnam. The article includes reviews of the accommodation and activities during the visit, including kayaking, hiking and cave exploration.</p>

  <p>The article highlights the trending topic of sustainable tourism in Vietnam, “as more and more locals realize their livelihood depends on the survival of their surrounding environment”. As tourism rises, small communities such as Phong Nha are striving to protect the natural beauty and authenticity of the area. Conservation projects ensure that the wildlife is protected and the community strives to recycle and up-cycle waste and unwanted materials.</p>

  <p><em>Epic Eco Travel’s article</em> also features a brief review and photos of <strong>Victory Road Villas</strong>, the first luxury boutique accommodation in Phong Nha. Newly opened in September 2017, Victory Road Villas has made a fantastic impression as it introduces a higher standard of accommodation to the area. The accommodation is beautifully constructed and decorated, successfully fusing French colonial style and traditional Vietnamese style.</p>

    contentHtml: `<p><strong>High up in the mountains and deep in the jungle - here you will find: untouched nature and authentic people.</strong></p>

  <p>David Scherz passionately documents his adventure trip to Vietnam in his twice published article <em>Vietnam: Hidden Natural Wonders</em>, published in <strong>Reiselust</strong> magazine and <strong>Traveller Online</strong>. His journey takes him through <strong>Phong Nha Ke-Bang</strong> on a <strong>Jungle Boss</strong> 2-day tour, to the breathtaking scenery of <strong>Ha Giang</strong> in north Vietnam, with intervals in the “mega-city” of <strong>Hanoi</strong> and a short beach rest stop in <strong>Da Nang</strong>. Read the full article translated from German below.</p>

  <p>The trip begins with <strong>Phong Nha Ke-Bang National Park</strong>, where the “crystal clear water” of <strong>Ma Da Lake</strong> is described by Scherz as he takes on the 2-day <strong>Ma Da and Abandoned Valley tour</strong> with Jungle Boss through the park. The tour explores the “gigantic” <strong>Elephant Cave</strong>, but what he finds more thrilling is the cave swimming in <strong>Tra Ang cave</strong>, where the experience of total darkness and silence in the cave, as he puts it, is <em>“a very powerful feeling, and possibly a real once-in-a-lifetime moment.”</em></p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>We begin into the water and swam 600 meters into the cave, everything around us completely darkened, and it was silent and still. 30 meters above us the ceiling, 20 meters below us the floor - a very powerful feeling, and possibly a real once-in-a-lifetime moment.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>David Scherz holds a strong focus on the authentic and untouched areas of Vietnam within his trip and his writing – places that are hidden or unknown to the typical tourist in Vietnam. At one point in the article, he specifically mentions avoiding the northern town of <strong>Sapa</strong>, which has recently and rapidly become saturated with tourism, to pursue the more authentic area of <strong>Ha Giang</strong>.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>The landscape above and around Sa Pa is one of the highlights, according to the many tourists and correspondingly the many hotels that are rising from the ground... we must go further north, up to the Chinese border, to the secluded Ha Giang Province.</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>There are countless serpentines going up and up, past secluded mountain villages, surrounded by lush greenery and lush vegetation. We feel as if we were in the middle of a documentary about the universe, it is so unbelievably beautiful here.</p>

  <p>At the end of the article, Scherz includes his list of <strong>“The most important info for your travel to Vietnam…”</strong> featuring <strong>Phong Nha Farmstay</strong> for accommodation alongside <strong>Jungle Boss Tours</strong> for activities in Phong Nha.</p>`,

    contentHtml: ` <p><strong>Have you ever wondered how the iconic Vietnamese conical hat (Non La Viet) is made?</strong> And have you ever wondered why the Vietnamese people are so sun-smart? Well, the answer to one of these questions can be answered at the <strong>Wild Boar Eco Farm</strong> in the beautiful <strong>Bong Lai Valley</strong> where you can now learn how to make your very own Vietnamese hat!</p>

  <p>The <strong>Bong Lai Valley</strong> is already a popular day out for many travellers and holidaymakers, offering breathtaking rural scenery and the opportunity to experience the real Vietnamese countryside and farming life. The recently launched <strong>Vietnamese hat making workshop</strong> at Wild Boar Eco Farm is a very welcomed addition to the already existing cultural activities in the Valley, alongside <em>The Duck Stop</em> and <em>The Pub With Cold Beer</em>.</p>

  <p><strong>Wild Boar Eco Farm</strong> is run by Mr. Cuong and his family and is not only the place to go these days for Vietnamese hat making and seeing wild boar, but is also a fantastic spot for swimming in the river or chilling out in a hammock with a beer and admiring the best views of the Valley. Another interesting way to appreciate the views here is by swinging right over them – yes, you read that right – you can swing over the picturesque views on the aptly named <strong>“Death Swing”</strong>. If that's not up your street, then maybe just stick to the hammocks and hat making. Food is also served here in the form of traditional pork or chicken and comes at a very reasonable price.</p>`,

    contentHtml: `<p>In Western culture, the concept of celebrating death may seem rather alien to us, not to mention a bit macabre. The topic of death and events such as funerals are something we tend not to dwell on or discuss. Our culture forces us to mourn and remember our loved ones in seclusion and privacy and we attempt to distract ourselves from all the emotions and swiftly return to the “normality” of our lives. There are no particularly special events held post-funeral, and the subsequent death anniversaries are sad days often spent in solitude or amongst only the closest of family.</p>

  <p>That is not the case for a large majority of the Vietnamese people, also known as the <strong>Kinh</strong> people, who celebrate death anniversaries. Death anniversaries (<em>ngày giỗ</em>) are amongst the most important dates of the year alongside <strong>Tết</strong>, the Vietnamese New Year celebration. In Vietnam, death anniversaries are sacred times at which to focus on the happiness and good that the person brought to the world. Death anniversaries bring the family and close friends together, to not only embrace the presence of their deceased loved one’s spirit, but also to truly embrace the presence of their living family members too.</p>

  <p>These occasions are always joyful ones and a great excuse for catching up with family and friends, feasting on delicious foods and heartily drinking. Most families celebrate several <em>ngày giỗ</em> per year, and usually the death anniversary of an ancestor is celebrated for following three generations.</p>

  <p>Food is an integral part of this celebration. The women of the family will spend the whole day, and maybe even the whole day before, preparing and cooking the deceased person’s favourite dishes, and also many other sweet and savoury Vietnamese specialties. One of these is likely to be <strong>bánh ít</strong>; a sweet rice roll which is pyramidical in shape and filled with caramelised crushed peanuts and wrapped in banana leaf. Fresh chicken and pork dishes are also popular at these feasts. Sometimes, if the party is really big, the family will hire external caterers to take care of all the food and a huge marquee filling the yard and overflowing onto the streets.</p>

  <p>Every family’s house has an altar or shrine which is placed in the most prominent possible position in the home, usually in the main common space or largest room and facing towards an entrance. Some altars are very large and in the form of a cabinet whereas others are smaller and shelf-like and affixed to the wall. Many families will have three or more altars, often arranged one atop of another, creating levels ascending like a pyramid.</p>

  <p>The altar is the focal point for the family’s religious services to their ancestors, and in the eyes of the family it makes each home the equivalent to Rome in Christianity; the pinnacle of religious status. The Kinh people worship their ancestors and treat the ancestral home as the most sacred place.</p>

  <p>The altar displays and stores the family’s most prized possessions, which are protected by the family’s spirits. If the altar is large enough, the family’s rice supply for the year is stored here too. On the death anniversary, the elaborate banquet will be laid out around or on the shrine and is offered firstly to the spirit of the loved one. Cooked and uncooked rice, hot rice soup, green tea, rice wine and incense are amongst some of the mandatory offerings, alongside photographs, memorabilia, flowers, various gifts and candles. The burning of paper items such as fake paper money is another common practice and this is a form of gift giving for the dead. Other paper items such as paper motorbikes, paper cars and paper toys for children are also common for this ritual, which is always carried out by the eldest patrilineal family member.</p>

  <p>The Kinh believe that the smoke from the burning incense will guide the dead to safety or safe passing, and will also guide them back home on days like these. The spirit cannot taste the food, but the spirit can smell the food, and can also smell the incense and flowers. The family members each light their own incense sticks and place it at the shrine to burn. When all of the incense has burned, it means the spirit has finished feasting, so the rest of the family can now rearrange the food for themselves and then tuck-in and enjoy each other’s company.</p>

    contentHtml: `<p>Clothes and shoes can be hard to buy in Vietnam for the adult westerner. A friend of mine wanted to buy a suit jacket in a “big size”. He tried finding one in the nearest city of Dong Hoi with no luck, and also tried looking in Hue, to no avail. He then went to Hanoi to acquire one and thought it may be better to try phoning around beforehand to investigate what the best options were. He rang H&amp;M, an international clothing retail store, and they said they had big sizes. He jumped in a cab and hightailed it across town to take a look. When he got there, they actually didn’t have anything that even remotely came anywhere close to fitting him. He tried a few more places and eventually gave up after he called an outlet called Adam Store on Truc Bac Lake and asked, “do you have big sized clothes?”. The shop assistant replied saying “sorry, but we only have clothes that fit people weighing up to 80kg”, and that my friend “sounded much heavier than that”.</p>

  <p>I have heard about many instances in Dong Hoi City where Western women have been refused entry into boutique clothing stores, with the sales staff saying “no, no, no, you very big, we only have small size, no foreigner, no foreigner”. It’s a bit embarrassing, but the Vietnamese obviously don’t seem to think so. When I meet a Vietnamese person for the first time, more often than not, they will ask my name, where I’m from, my age, marital status, and then after telling them I’m married, they will ask how many children I have. Lastly, if it hadn’t already been asked, they almost always ask how much I weigh followed by patting my belly. This is followed by looks of disbelief when I inform them that I weigh over 100kg and an onslaught of jokes about lucky money and happy buddha.</p>

  <p>Phong Nha, despite being a small town, has a handful of clothing outlets with “big sizes”. <strong>Wild Phong Nha</strong> sells long pants, jackets, lightweight tops and trekking shoes in Western sizes and is owned by Mr. Bamboo, who is a local cave guide and learned his trade from running adventure tours in Da Lat.</p>

  <p>Another great place in town to buy clothes is <strong>Phuc Dat Shop</strong>. Phuc Dat specialises in unique Phong Nha orientated t-shirts, hats and fleeces and other handmade souvenirs. There is the local market too, but it can be an odd shopping experience where you may find what you’re looking for or you may find yourself bewildered. Be sure to bargain with the merchants at the market and try before you buy.</p>`,

    They say whatever you're looking for, you will find here. They say you come to Vietnam and you understand a lot in a few minutes, but the rest has got to be lived. The smell: that's the first thing that hits you, promising everything in exchange for your soul. And the heat. Your shirt is straightaway a rag. You can hardly remember your name, or what you came to escape from. But at night, there's a breeze. The river is beautiful. You could be forgiven for thinking there was no war; that the gunshots were fireworks; that only pleasure matters. A pipe of opium, or the touch of a girl who might tell you she loves you. And then, something happens, as you knew it would. And nothing can ever be the same again.

    Having lived in Vietnam 12 years and worked in tourism here for 8 years, I often get asked questions about the history and culture of the country. The primary reason for the creation of the Visit Phong Nha website was to answer these questions through the publication of articles and information. This article in particular gives an overview of what I have found to be some very informative and intriguing books and movies about the Far Eastern people of Vietnam and their land. The best way to get under the skin of a country is to study it by looking at it through the eyes of the locals. This article also discusses books and movies about Vietnam that are based on real experiences and historical events. If you are interested in learning more about the history and culture of Vietnam and what makes Vietnam unique, please continue reading to see my personal recommendations for the best movies and books about Vietnam.

    <strong>Vietnamese Movies</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Many Vietnamese movies rely on different substories coming together to weave a complete picture and these stories don’t always end in a happily-ever-after. They often leave you questioning, unlike the well-rounded Hollywood plots we have become so used too. Vietnamese movies don’t exist to make you feel good and aren’t to be enjoyed as a frivolous pastime. They always contain a strong message and are very artistic.
  </p>
  <p><strong>The White Silk Dress (2006)</strong><br>Vietnamese with subtitles</p>
  <p>
    A romance about two servants from Ha Dong who flee to Hoi An to seek a better life together and escape from the suffering they endure at the hands of their feudal masters. Set on Cam Nam Island near Hoi An (where Randy’s Bookstore is now located) during the French occupation of Vietnam. This movie is a great insight into the unfairness of colonialism and the feudal system that was enforced by the overlords.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Cyclo (1995)</strong><br>Vietnamese with subtitles</p>
  <p>A very dark insight into poverty and the hardships of survival on the streets of Ho Chi Minh City during the 1980’s. Mafia gangs, corruption in the police force, exploitation and vice. This movie exposes what it was really like post-war.</p>
  <p><strong>The Scent of Green Papaya (1993)</strong><br>Vietnamese with subtitles</p>
  <p>A love story about a maid who sets out to steal the heart of her employer and strives to become the lady she always wanted to be.</p>
  <p><strong>The Rebel (2007)</strong><br>Vietnamese with subtitles</p>
  <p>A contemporary style movie that encompasses martial arts and a love story whilst informing the audience about the past. This is a period drama with plenty of action which retains the typical melancholy that makes Vietnamese movies unique.</p>
  <p><strong>Foreign Movies</strong></p>
  <p><strong>The Quiet American (2002)</strong><br>Starring Michael Cain</p>
  <p>Based on the novel by Graham Greene and mostly filmed in Hoi An due to the town’s architecture. The first film adaptation was made in 1958 and starred Michael Redgrave, but the one I’m recommending here is the adaptation released in 2002. The movie is set during the French Indochina War in Vietnam in 1952 and is a murder mystery that revolves around a love triangle.</p>
  <p><strong>Oliver Stone’s Vietnam Trilogy</strong><br>Oliver Stone was opposed to the war, yet he volunteered to serve two tours. This was because he thought it was unfair that the less privileged were called to serve through the draft. This lead him to quit university and join the Marines, much to his parents dismay.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Platoon (1986)</strong> – Starring Charlie Sheen</li>
    <li><strong>Born on the Fourth of July (1989)</strong> – Starring Tom Cruise</li>
    <li><strong>Heaven & Earth (1993)</strong> – Starring Tommy Lee Jones</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Good Morning Vietnam (1987)</strong><br>Starring Robin Williams</p>
  <p>A radio DJ from the American Army based in Crete is sent to Vietnam to become a “shock jock”, embarrassing the more conservative side of Army Intelligence and making waves with his unorthodox approach. There is an underlying political anti-war theme to the movie but it could also be seen as nostalgic.</p>
  <p><strong>Indochine (1992)</strong><br>Starring Catherine Deneuve and Vincent Perez</p>
  <p>An epic masterpiece of a drama about French Indochine. South East Asia’s version of “Out of Africa”, this movie reveals how the French colonial system operated and why it was never going to work.</p>
  <p><strong>The Sapphires (2012)</strong><br>An Australian film based on a true story about an Indigenous Australian band who performed soul music to American troops in Vietnam during the American War.</p>
  <p><strong>Vietnamese Publications</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>The Sorrow of War</strong> by Bao Ninh</li>
    <li><strong>Heritage Magazine</strong> (Vietnam Airlines Inflight Magazine)</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Foreign Publications</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Saigon</strong> by Anthony Grey</li>
    <li><strong>Hanoi Adieu</strong> by Mandaley Perkins</li>
    <li><strong>The Quiet American</strong> by Graham Greene</li>
    <li><strong>When Heaven and Earth Changed Places</strong> by Le Ly Hayslip</li>
    <li><strong>Catfish and Mandala</strong> by Andrew X Pham</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Where to Get Books and Movies in Vietnam</strong></p>
  <p>In Hoi An, Randy’s Bookstore on Cam Nam Island is a great resource. In Phong Nha, books are for sale and exchange at Capture Vietnam alongside great pizza and carrot cake!</p>

As the meaning of the name suggests, Tết celebrations begin on the first day of the first month of the lunar calendar, the Lunar New Year, which is also considered to be the arrival of the Spring season.</p>

    <p>Many visitors don’t know what Tết is and if you are at all interested in understanding and experiencing the culture of Vietnam, then Tết is the metaphorical cherry on the cake. We have put together this two-part article to give some background information about this culture-rich celebration and how you can get involved in the celebrations. This year, the first day of Tết is on the 16th of February, so if you are visiting during this time, you should certainly continue reading!</p>

    <p>Tết is hugely important to the Vietnamese for many reasons. In the past, Tết was an essential holiday because it provided one of few longer breaks during the agricultural year, which was held between the harvesting of the crops and the sowing of the next crops. More recently, it is viewed as the time to influence the upcoming year to be full of luck, fortune and success for you, your family and friends. It is also an occasion for the Vietnamese to express their respect and remembrance for their ancestors through various rituals and offerings.</p>

    <p>Similarly to Western traditions for embracing the New Year, for the Vietnamese, Tết is the best time to lay a clean slate, so to speak. Debts are settled, old grievances are forgiven, and houses are cleaned of dirt and clutter, all in the hope of setting the stage for attracting as much luck and good fortune as possible for the year. It is also a time to reminisce on the important events and moments from the previous year, and is seen as an opportunity for families and friends to spend quality time together to drink, eat, and celebrate.</p>

    <p>Vietnamese people usually return to their family homes during Tết, which is often located outside of the big cities, rurally or in the suburbs, so a large percentage of people will travel during this time. Some return to worship at the family altar or visit the graves of their ancestors in their homeland. They also tidy the graves of their ancestors as a sign of respect. The family altar, found in every Vietnamese household, is the focal point of Vietnamese worship, and is doted on all year round, but especially at this time of year. Traditional offerings to the altar include a fruit platter with five kinds of fruit, fake paper money and votive papers, rice, tea, and the burning of incense.</p>

    <p>The three most important days of the holiday are the first three days. The first day is normally reserved for close family, with some regions dedicating the first day to the paternal side of the family. The second day is more relaxed, with many relatives and friends visiting each other’s houses to celebrate. In some parts of Vietnam, the second day is dedicated to the maternal side of the family and the third day is dedicated to teachers, who command a lot of respect in Vietnam.</p>

    <p>Many Vietnamese celebrate by preparing and consuming special holiday food. These foods include <em>bánh chưng</em>, a sticky rice cake filled with pork and mung beans; <em>bánh dầy</em>, a round rice cake served with sausage meat; <em>canh măng</em>, young bamboo soup; and much more. These special foods and beverages shared and eaten over the entire holiday period and generously offered to any visitors to the household, so there must be plenty to go round!</p>

    <p>People consider what they do on the dawn of Tết will determine their fate for the whole year, hence people always smile and treat everyone with the utmost kindness in the hope for a better year. Many families stay at home on the first day of Tết, especially if not invited to another house, and only visit from the second day onwards. During the visiting times, gifts are given to friends and relatives, especially children and the elderly, who are given lucky money in a special red envelope. Also on the first day, everybody will wear brand new clothes, particularly children. The traditional attire is the <em>áo dài</em>, the Vietnamese tunic dress, usually in the colours yellow or red as these are the luckiest colours. Like other Asian countries, Vietnamese believe that the color of red and yellow will bring good fortune, which is why you see the colours everywhere during this period, and of course they are the two colours that make up the Vietnamese flag for this very reason.</p>

    <p>In the days or weeks leading up to the Lunar New Year, in an effort to get rid of the bad luck or misfortune from the previous year, people will spend a few days cleaning their homes, polishing every utensil, or even repaint and decorate the house with kumquat trees (a small citrus fruit), branches of peach blossom, and many other colourful plants and flowers. A significant amount of effort is put into choosing the perfect plants for decorating the home as the size and beauty of the plants reflects wealth, good fortune, and dedication to ancestors and family. For example, the perfect kumquat tree would have to bear not only fully grown fruits but also younger fruits and buds. This is a metaphor for family members both young and old and having a tree like this will bring good health generations of the past, present and future.</p>

    <p>One of the most important traditions observed during Tết is organisation of who will be the first person to enter the family home in the New Year. If good things come to the family on the first day of the Lunar New Year, the year will be full of blessings, so usually a person with sought after qualities such as kindness, good temper and morality will be invited to enter the home first. However, to ensure the best chances of good luck, the owner of the household will leave the house just a few minutes before midnight and come back inside after the clock strikes midnight into the New Year, to prevent anyone else from entering the house who might bring misfortune. Furthermore, it is seen as very bad luck to break anything on the first day of Tết, or to cut your hair or your fingernails. Sweeping during Tết is taboo or <em>xui</em> (unlucky), since it symbolises sweeping the good luck away, that is why they clean before the New Year. It is also <em>xui</em> for anyone who has recently experienced the loss of a family member to visit somebody else’s house during the Tết period, though it is not uncommon for people to visit them at their house instead.</p>

    <p>As you can see, there are countless traditions and beliefs that revolve around this celebration. Tết is a fascinating time to be in Vietnam and to experience authentic Vietnamese culture, and a time to see the Vietnamese people at their very best. Sounds like fun, right? Stay tuned for part two of this article, in which will be advising you on how to make the most of Tết and how to get involved in the celebrations in Phong Nha.</p>`,

    contentHtml: `<h1>How to Make the Most of Tết</h1>
    <p>If you’ve read Part 1 of Tết Holiday in Vietnam, you’ll understand just how much of a major holiday it is for the Vietnamese – imagine Christmas, New Year and Easter all rolled into one! It’s hectic, crazy, busy and noisy, but it is fantastic.</p>
    <p>Every year we hear two different stories about Tết from travellers: those that loved it, and those that found it a complete nightmare! This comes down to your expectations and how flexible you are willing to be. Most people who really enjoy Tết decide in advance where they want to be for it, arrive a couple of days before and then stay there for the duration (normally 5 days or more). These travellers will try to get involved with the local celebrations as well as relaxing and trying not to do too much, which could be very welcomed after a period of fast-paced traveling. Those that find Tết frustrating are those that try to continue traveling during it and those that just want to do the normal touristic activities like visit museums and attractions. This article is here to help you to be the former and offer advice you on how to enjoy and make the most of this exciting time in Vietnam!</p>

    <h2>Getting around during Tết</h2>
    <p>Tết is HUGE in Vietnam and a majority of the Vietnamese people will travel back to their family home or hometown for Tết, usually outside of the cities. This causes a mass migration of people traveling from the cities to the countryside before the Lunar New Year and of course returning after it. Due to this, transport for the week before Tết and the week after is often fully booked well in advance, and during the main celebration days of Tết, most transport is not running at all. So it is really important if you want to travel during Tết that you do your research, plan where you want to go and book your travel as far in advance as you can.</p>
    <p>Bare in mind that you may end up needing to use private transport, such as private cars, and you may end up having to fly or get the train between places rather than taking a bus. Be prepared for transport to be challenging, expensive and busy before and after, and nearly non-existent during. The easiest way to get around this problem is to simply not travel. Choose somewhere you want to spend Tết, book ahead and spend the week there.</p>

    <h2>What to do during Tết</h2>
    <p>Many tourist attractions will be closed for up to a week for Tết. Museums, places of interest, natural wonders and guided tours and activities can all close! If you want to continue being a tourist during this festival season, plan ahead. Try to think of alternative things to do during this period. Get involved in street celebrations, or befriend local Vietnamese and hang out with them! Tết is the best time to see and experience Vietnamese traditions, culture, food, games, and revelry. Locals will often become more congenial and outgoing during Tết, so it is a great time to make friends. Explore by foot, on bicycles or on scooters, and maybe you’ll be waved down and invited into locals homes and have the opportunity to try the foods that are specially prepared for the festivities. Rice wine is commonly drunk over Tết, so be careful, it’s very strong!</p>

    <h2>Where to stay during Tết</h2>
    <p>Most accommodations will usually close or operate a limited service due to having fewer staff on hand, so options will be limited and those that are open will be busy. Furthermore, many affluent Vietnamese families will take advantage of the national holiday by traveling to touristic areas to celebrate and enjoy time away from work. Therefore, popular beach areas and touristic towns such as Hoi An will be even busier with more sightseers than usual. Again, it’s really important that you book ahead. Fewer hotels will be open, and those that are will increase their accommodation prices sharply with a high demand in central areas. In Phong Nha, Shambalaa Hostel will be remaining open for Tết. Shambalaa Hostel will also be running a “Tết tour” through the village, giving you the opportunity to meet and celebrate with some of the local families.</p>

    <h2>Where to eat during Tết</h2>
    <p>Just like hotels, transport, and attractions, many markets and restaurants close during Tết. Nowadays, you can generally always find somewhere local offering food, but for a couple of days at least, expect that #1 TripAdvisor restaurant to be closed and be prepared to settle for something else, or whatever is still open.</p>

    <h2>To sum it up…</h2>
    <p>At the end of the day, those that enjoy Tết tend to be those that go with the flow and get involved. As previously mentioned, many people go back home to the countryside, so rural areas like Phong Nha are often the best places to experience Tết. So on the contrary to what you may think, it will be more difficult to get involved in Tết if you’re in a city. Cities are vast and hard to get around without transport and Vietnamese people will be few and far between. In rural towns and villages it is easier to get around by foot or bicycle, meet the locals and enjoy the festivities!</p>
    <p>We highly recommend that you decide where you want to spend Tết in advance, get there, and settle down for the ride. Talk to the hotel staff and find out what is still open and what events are being held that you might be able to attend or enjoy from a distance. You may find that if you befriend the hotel staff, that you will be invited to join them! “Chúc Mừng Năm Mới” is the phrase traditionally used to wish people a Happy New Year, learn it, and don’t be afraid to use it!</p>
    <p>So, to sum it up… expect to pay a bit more, expect service to be slower, expect the streets to be noisy on Tết Eve; expect traditionally busy areas to be quiet and quiet areas to be busy, expect tourist destinations and restaurants to be closed for a few days and expect travel to be a real pain! Join in with the local celebrations if you want, or chill out at your hotel for a couple of days and pick up that book you’ve been meaning to finish. Be forgiving and flexible, because who can blame these wonderful people for wanting to spend a few days celebrating life and love with their families and friends?</p>
    <p><strong>Chúc Mừng Năm Mới and good luck to you all!</strong></p>`,
